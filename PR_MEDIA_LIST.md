## Outreach Playbook

### Before Pitching (2-3 weeks)
- Follow all targets on Twitter/X
- Engage genuinely with their content (reply, share, quote tweet)
- Don't be thirsty - just be present

### The Pitch Email

```
Subject: New dating app for people who outgrew Hinge

Hey [Name],

Saw your piece on [recent article] - [one genuine sentence about it].

I built Feels, a dating app for the wave of people leaving Hinge for Feeld
but finding Feeld broken. NYC-first launch, solo founder, kink-curious but
not full ENM.

Happy to give you early access or chat if you're covering the dating app space.

[Your name]
```

### Rules
- No attachments
- No press release
- No "revolutionary AI-powered platform"
- 2-3 paragraphs max

### Have Ready
- 3-4 high-res screenshots
- Founder photo
- One-paragraph app description

- Access codes for them to try it

---

## Angles to Pitch

### For Tech Press (TechCrunch)
- Solo founder, vibe-coded, no VC
- NYC-first launch strategy
- Competing with stagnant incumbents (Hinge, Feeld)

### For Dating/Sex Press
- "Feeld but the chat doesn't suck and the app gets updated"
- Kink-curious mainstream (not vanilla, not full kink)
- Forced queue processing = everyone gets seen
- All likes visible for free (no paywall on who liked you)

### For Lifestyle/NYC Press
- NYC dating scene story
- Founder story (why you built it)
- The "Hinge to Feeld" migration trend

---

## Target Publications

**Tech**: TechCrunch, Wired, The Verge

**Dating/Sex**: Mashable, Cosmopolitan, Glamour, Refinery29, Vice, InsideHook, Bustle

**NYC Lifestyle**: The Cut, Gothamist, Time Out New York

**Podcasts**: Seeing Other People, dating/relationship pods

## Notes

- Dating app PR is about timing - launch day spike matters
- One good article = 1,000+ free installs
- PR is unpredictable - don't pay monthly retainer, do project-based for launch
- The goal is 5 journalists who know you, not 100 cold emails
